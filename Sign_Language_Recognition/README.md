![ASL TEST](test.jpeg)

## Project Features.

- Detects and recgnize real time American sign language 1-10 Signs .

## Prerequisites

- Python3
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Yolo and Darknet-53

- For Real time object Detection [Yolo](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) (You Only Look Once) is used.
- [Darknet-53](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/) is used to train model for face detection.
- Darknet is an open source neural network framework by [Joseph Redmon](https://github.com/pjreddie)
