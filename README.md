### This repository contains the research work, and projects related to data driven accessible system.

## But first, What is the meaning of Data-driven.
### Without data you’re just another person with an opinion.

### William Edwards Deming

### Data-drivenness is about building tools, abilities, and, most crucially, a culture that acts on data. This chapter will outline what sets data-driven organizations apart. I start with some initial prerequisites about data collection and access. I then contrast reporting and alerting versus analyses in some detail because it is such an important distinction. There are many different types of forward-looking analysis, varying in degrees of sophistication. Thus, I spend some time going over those types, describing them in terms of “levels of analytics” and “analytics maturity,” in particular, discussing the hallmarks of an analytically mature organization.

### This research is actually divided into 5 part which are as mention before..

1. A USER POWERED INDIAN SIGN LANGUAGE DICTIONARY
2. READING & LEARNING SMARTFONTS
